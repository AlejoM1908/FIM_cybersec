File Integrity Monitoring

## Description
The File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is a tool that allows the user to monitor the integrity of certain files and directories. The user can specify which files and directories to monitor and the tool will check if any changes have been made to the files and directories through the time. Any adition, deletion or modification of the files and directories will be detected and reported to the user.

## Usage
the required dependencies are stored in the *requirements.txt* file. To install them, run the following command:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt # Windows based systems
pip3 install -r requirements.txt # Unix based systems
```

To run the tool, run the following command:

```

we recommend the use of a virtual environment to run the tool. To create a virtual environment, run the following command:
